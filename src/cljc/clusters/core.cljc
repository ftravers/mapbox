;; This page is broken up into two sub components, the first is the
;; list of clusters and regions.  The second is the interactive mapbox
;; map of regions.  To allow these two components to communicate,
;; without causing un-necessary coupling a pub-sub queue is used to
;; handle inter component communication.  Here is a list of events
;; that are sent:


;; map-state documentation
{;; everything lives under this root 
 :geography
 {
  ;; This is the channel (core async queue) upon which
  ;; information (events/messages) should be sent that need handling
  ;; by a component outside the current components scope.
  :send-ch (async/chan)

  ;; Contains a function that takes one argument, a keyword that
  ;; represents the type of message this channel will listen for.  For
  ;; example, it could be the message: :region-list-modified, the
  ;; would have as payload the list of regions that have been modified
  :make-subscription-fn (fn [event-name])

  ;; the full list of all regions
  :regions
  {;; key is region id
   0
   {;; full region name
    :region/name "San Mateo County, CA"}}

  ;; the users defined clusters, keys are cluster ID's
  :clusters
  {;; cluster ID
   0
   {:cluster/name "Top Shelf Valley"

    ;; the class the html element should be, can also be
    ;; "card-hover" or "card-selected"
    :class "card"

    ;; the region ids that correspond to this cluster
    :selected-regions [0 1 2 3]
